# Community Voting Token (CVT)

## 1. Project Title
**Community Voting Token (CVT)**

## 2. Project Description
Community Voting Token (CVT) is a blockchain-based fungible token built using the Clarity smart contract language. It is designed to empower decentralized governance by enabling community members to vote on proposals using their CVT tokens.  
Token holders can participate in decision-making by casting votes proportional to the number of tokens they own.

## 3. Project Vision
To create a transparent, fair, and secure voting system where every community member's voice is counted proportionally to their contribution, represented by tokens.

## 4. Future Scope
- Add **proposal creation** and **voting deadlines**.
- Implement **delegated voting** where token holders can assign their votes.
- Create **on-chain proposal execution**.
- Add a **reward system** for active participants.
- Integrate with **DAO frameworks** for complete governance.
